        <h1>Title: "Love Type Error"</h1>
        <p><em><samp>Premise:</samp></em><br>
           Baek Ji-won, a by-the-book HR manager at a major cosmetics company, is forced into a fake relationship with Choi Hyun-woo, a free-spirited, notoriously flirtatious product developer, to protect the company’s reputation after they're caught in a compromising misunderstanding. As they pretend to be a couple to calm the gossip mill, real feelings sneak in—and chaos follows.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="tab2" class="tab-content">
        <h3>Episode 1: “Caught on Camera”</h3>
        <p>Baek Ji-won and Choi Hyun-woo get stuck in the office elevator after hours. Security footage shows them falling on top of each other—literally—and gossip spreads like wildfire. To avoid fueling dating rumors that could affect their professional standings, they’re “advised” by the CEO to pretend to be in a relationship. They both hate the idea.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Episode 2: “Clause 1: No Kissing”</h3>
        <p>Ji-won drafts a hilariously specific “Fake Relationship Contract,” complete with no-kissing and no-eye-contact clauses. Hyun-woo mocks her rules but signs it anyway. They start faking affection at work, including awkward lunch dates and “candid” couple selfies. But when Hyun-woo unexpectedly defends her from a rude executive, Ji-won sees a new side of him.</p>
        <br><br><br><br><br><br>
      </div>
      <div id="tab3" class="tab-content">
        <h3>Episode 3: “Fake First Date”</h3>
        <p>To sell the illusion, they go on a “first date” at a trendy rooftop café. Ji-won prepares bullet points. Hyun-woo brings a deck of cheesy pickup lines. The evening is a disaster—until it isn’t. After sharing embarrassing childhood stories, they end the night laughing. Ji-won smiles genuinely for the first time in ages.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Episode 4: “Jealousy Protocol”</h3>
        <p>Hyun-woo flirts with a visiting intern to make Ji-won jealous. It backfires when Ji-won coolly approves of their “chemistry.” Later, Ji-won runs into her ex-fiancé at a company event. Hyun-woo steps in as her charming fake boyfriend, leaving the ex stunned. Ji-won’s heart skips, unsure if it’s relief… or something more.</p>
        <br><br><br><br><br><br>
      </div>
      <div id="tab4" class="tab-content">
        <h3>Episode 5: “The Accidental Sleepover”</h3>
        <p>A company retreat forces them to share a room. Ji-won insists on building a pillow barrier. Hyun-woo secretly watches her sleep-talking about how “he’s not that bad.” The next morning, she wakes up to find him making her coffee—just the way she likes it. She’s flustered. He’s smug. The lines are blurring.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Episode 6: “Office Scandal 2.0”</h3>
        <p>Photos of them looking too affectionate leak online. The PR team spins it as a “company love story,” pushing them into the spotlight. Now, they're expected to appear as the perfect couple at a press event. Ji-won panics under the pressure, but Hyun-woo keeps her calm. He’s not just faking it anymore—and neither is she.</p>
        <br><br><br><br><br><br>
      </div>
      <div id="tab5" class="tab-content">
        <h3>Episode 7: “A Real Confession, Almost”</h3>
        <p>Hyun-woo almost confesses his growing feelings—but stops when Ji-won refers to their relationship as “purely strategic.” He puts on a happy face, but becomes more distant. Ji-won senses the shift, misses his teasing, and begins questioning what she truly wants. Meanwhile, a new team member shows interest in her—and Hyun-woo doesn’t like it.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Episode 8: “The Break Clause”</h3>
        <p>Ji-won suggests ending the contract early, convinced they’ve fulfilled their “duties.” Hyun-woo agrees, acting unaffected. But both struggle with the breakup—even if it was fake. Ji-won can’t focus, while Hyun-woo’s new product flops. They’re miserable apart but too stubborn to admit why. Meanwhile, their coworkers notice—and plot to push them back together.</p>
        <br><br><br><br><br><br>
      </div>
      <div id="tab6" class="tab-content">
        <h3>Episode 9: “Confessions & Clarity”</h3>
        <p>Trapped together during a company power outage, emotions boil over. Ji-won finally admits she liked their fake relationship… because it felt real. Hyun-woo confesses that he fell for her a long time ago. They kiss for the first time—contract be damned. The power comes back on, and they find half the office watching. Again.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Episode 10: “Redefining Real”</h3>
        <p>Now officially dating, Ji-won and Hyun-woo struggle to adjust. Real arguments feel different. Real emotions are scarier. Hyun-woo is giddy about PDA; Ji-won sets boundaries. They slowly find balance, learning to support each other genuinely. Ji-won opens up about her fear of abandonment. Hyun-woo promises not to run—even if things aren’t perfect.</p>
        <br><br><br><br><br><br>
      </div>
      <div id="tab7" class="tab-content">
        <h3>Episode 11: “The Ex Returns”</h3>
        <p>Ji-won’s ex comes back, not to win her over, but to offer her a job at a prestigious firm overseas. It’s her dream role, but it means leaving Hyun-woo—and Seoul. She’s torn between career and love. Hyun-woo, trying to be supportive, pretends he’s okay with whatever she chooses. But it’s killing him inside.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Episode 12: “The Rooftop Goodbye”</h3>
        <p>On her last night before flying out, Hyun-woo invites Ji-won to the café where their first fake date took place. He thanks her for making him believe in love again. Ji-won kisses him goodbye. But at the airport, she hesitates. Flashbacks of their memories play in her mind. She makes a decision.</p>
        <br><br><br><br><br><br>
      </div>
      <div id="tab8" class="tab-content">
        <h3>Episode 13: “The Return Clause”</h3>
        <p>Ji-won returns—but secretly. She takes a new local job and plans to surprise Hyun-woo. Instead, she sees him with a mystery woman. Turns out, it’s his cousin. Embarrassed but relieved, she finally confronts him. He’s stunned but overjoyed. They officially reunite—and this time, no contract, no lies. Just love.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Episode 14: “Love Under Review”</h3>
        <p>The company investigates their relationship, suspecting favoritism. Ji-won volunteers to transfer to another department, but Hyun-woo refuses to let her sacrifice her role again. They confront the board as a team, proving their love didn’t affect work performance. They’re cleared. Ji-won kisses him in front of everyone. No more hiding.</p>
        <br><br><br><br><br><br>
      </div>
      <div id="tab9" class="tab-content">
        <h3>Episode 15: “Anniversary.exe”</h3>
        <p>It’s been a year since their “fake” relationship began. Hyun-woo plans an elaborate celebration with candles, cake, and a projector playing every picture they ever took—fake and real. Ji-won, moved beyond words, gives him a new contract: a marriage proposal. He signs it instantly. Clause 1: Love Forever.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Episode 16: “Contractually Ever After”</h3>
        <p>The finale features their wedding—full of quirky coworkers, mishaps, and heartwarming vows. Hyun-woo cries more than Ji-won. They move into their new apartment, bicker over shelf space, and kiss it away. As they cuddle on the couch, Ji-won jokes about drafting a “honeymoon contract.” Hyun-woo smirks, “As long as clause one stays the same.” Fade out.</p>
